## Embedding YouTube Videos in Obsidian Digital Garden
#Omnivore

[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/https-github-com-oleeskild-obsidian-digital-garden-issues-80-18e546c8a93)
[Read Original](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden/issues/80)

### Highlights

> What you could do right now to make this possible is to use the embed feature of youtube videos. This would create a youtube player in your note. (This should work both in obsidian and in your garden). It would look something like this:
> 
> ```html
> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/djV11Xbc914" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
> ```
> 
> The downside of course is that you would have to upload the video to youtube first. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-github-com-oleeskild-obsidian-digital-garden-issues-80-18e546c8a93#37948ab8-f578-4ef2-9ea3-88cf7ec97eae)

iframe code missing when pubished to Obsidian.
