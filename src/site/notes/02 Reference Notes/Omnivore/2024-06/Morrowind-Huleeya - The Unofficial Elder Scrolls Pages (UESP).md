### Highlights

> **Argonians**: _"We are counted among the First Peoples. Our homeland is Argonia, or Black Marsh, in Imperial speech. I am a poor example. My parents were bound in slavery, and I have lived in Morrowind all my life. Like other Argonians who have accepted Imperial ways, I am much like any other Imperial citizen. But to be honest, we have always been a private, even secretive people, and I am not comfortable speaking in this manner. You might do better to look in books, if you are curious."_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-en-m-uesp-net-wiki-morrowind-huleeya-1904c77a6c6#30f42ab3-b682-40f5-864e-6db496c7bccc)

> * _"I'm sorry. I don't know why you'd tell me this. In the old country, they set great store by dreams and omens. But I am an educated creature. Dreams mean nothing. They are just... fancies. Imagination."_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-en-m-uesp-net-wiki-morrowind-huleeya-1904c77a6c6#22cac165-37f4-4560-9706-767ffa4ed6f0)

Argonian culture places great stock on dreams and omens.
