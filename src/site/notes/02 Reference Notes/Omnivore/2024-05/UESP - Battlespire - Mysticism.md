### Highlights

> The School of **Mysticism** specializes in the most arcane and mysterious working of magic. Many of the spell effects are curious and specific, not fitting into any of the other areas of magic.

An eloquent description of 'Mysticism' from ['An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire'](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Battlespire:Battlespire). I like the phrase "Many of the spell effects are curious and specific".
