Wikipedia - The Did You Know section showcases new or expanded articles that are selected through an informal review process. It is not a general trivia section. The choice of articles is subject to a set of criteria that are set out on this page.

_This page is powered by [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app) ‐ you can read more about how I use Omnivore here: [[02 Reference Notes/Omnivore/Omnivore - Saving Articles for Citations in Obsidian\|Omnivore - Saving Articles for Citations in Obsidian]]._

### Highlights

> DYK showcases new and improved content by presenting a series of facts ("hooks"), some of them accompanied by images, which link to selected articles. The hooks appear for a limited period in the "Did you know...?" box on the Main Page. Editors whose articles appear in DYK will receive an acknowledgement on their user talk pages. The choice of articles is subject to a series of criteria (see [DYK rules](#DYK%5Frules) below). Editors may [nominate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:DYKNOM "Wikipedia:DYKNOM") their own or someone else's work for a DYK appearance.

Wikipedia _'Did you know'_ section is a 'hook' to direct users to new and improved content. It supplements _'Today's Featured Article'_. Could be implemented as a community engagement showcase on #MMW
