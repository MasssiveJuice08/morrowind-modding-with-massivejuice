UESP article on the book 'Mysticism' found in Morrowind

### Highlights

> The [Psijics](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Psijic%5FOrder "Lore:Psijic Order") of the [Isle of Artaeum](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Artaeum "Lore:Artaeum") have a different term for Mysticism: the Old Way. The phrase becomes bogged in semantic quagmire because the Old Way also refers to the religion and customs of the Psijics, which may or may not be part of the magic of Mysticism. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/morrowind-mysticism-book-the-unofficial-elder-scrolls-pages-uesp-18f2df39ed1#1f52d08e-f1b3-40de-b09e-864bdba4c148)

The [Psijic Order](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Psijic_Order) could be interesting.

> Discussion within the Order of Psijics after Artaeum's reappearance has led some scholars to postulate that Mysticism is less spiritual in nature as was originally supposed, and that either the intellect or the emotional state of the believer is sufficient to influence its energy configuration and flow.

Is mysticism spiritual in nature?

> None of these explanations is truly satisfactory taken by itself. For the beginning student of Mysticism, it is best simply to learn the patterns distinguishable in the maelstrom of centuries past. The more patterns are discovered, the clearer the remaining ones become. Until, of course, they change. For inevitably they have to. And then the journey begins anew.

Discerning patterns in the "maelstrom of centuries past" so the remaining patterns become clearer. Prophesized pattern?
