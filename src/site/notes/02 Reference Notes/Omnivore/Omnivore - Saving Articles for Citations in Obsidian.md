## About

[![Omnivore.app Logo|right wsmall](https://i.imgur.com/0YszZiM.png)](https://omnivore.app/)

I use [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/) to save articles and documents while researching a topic. It allows me to tag ('label') them, highlight passages and add notes to my highlights. I'm a pretty forgetful person and with ADHD my brain is working like, what, 512mb of RAM anyway? Omnivore helps me to save sources which are important to me, which I can make notes on and cite later.

It's been a great addition to my workflow, as it removes a lot of the manual labour of saving sources when researching a topic. It integrates well with Obsidian through its [Obsidian plugin](https://docs.omnivore.app/integrations/obsidian.html). Some saved content from does not render correctly in Obsidian, but I can [[02 Reference Notes/Omnivore Manual Entry/00 About Omnivore Manual Entry\|manually enter these Omnivore articles]] to get around that. Publishing these to my Digital Garden website also required [[01 Fleeting Notes/Omnivore Frontmatter for Obsidian & Digital Garden\|some tweaks to the Omnivore plugin's settings]].
Paid alternatives to Omnivore include [Readwise](https://readwise.io/), which also supports Obsidian integration.
