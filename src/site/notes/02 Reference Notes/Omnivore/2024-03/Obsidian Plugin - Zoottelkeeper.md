> 
> So, the idea behind Zoottelkeeper is to help you generate the base form of these maps automatically. It does so by indexing all the files and folders that lay in a folder, thus creating a link from the file to all it's content.

[Zoottelkeeper](https://github.com/akosbalasko/zoottelkeeper-obsidian-plugin/tree/master) creates dynamic MOCs of folders in Obsidian. It integrates well with [Obsidian-Folder-Notes](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes). Together these _could possibly_ offer folder MOCs that are viewable in both Obsidian and Quartz.
