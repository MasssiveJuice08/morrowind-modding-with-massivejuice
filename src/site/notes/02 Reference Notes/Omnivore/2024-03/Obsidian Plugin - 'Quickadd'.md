### Highlights

> ## QuickAdd
> 
> [](#quickadd)
> 
> QuickAdd is a powerful combination of four tools (called choices): templates, captures, macros, and multis.
> 
> A [**Template**](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/Choices/TemplateChoice) is a definition of how to create a new note, and composes with Obsidian's own Templates core plugin or community template plugins. For example, it would allow you to define a quick action to create a new note in a particular location, with a templatized title, and templated content.
> 
> A [**Capture**](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/Choices/CaptureChoice) allows you to quickly add content to predefined files. For example, you could set up a quick action to add a link to the open file to your daily note under a specific section.
> 
> [**Macros**](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/Choices/MacroChoice) will allow you to compound these two together into powerful chained workflows. Imagine pressing one hotkey to automatically create a new note to track a chess match with a specific template, while automatically adding a reference to it in your "list of matches" note and in your daily note.

Extend use of templates/templater to also include automated content generation, such as creating a particular note template if creating a note in a particular folder.
