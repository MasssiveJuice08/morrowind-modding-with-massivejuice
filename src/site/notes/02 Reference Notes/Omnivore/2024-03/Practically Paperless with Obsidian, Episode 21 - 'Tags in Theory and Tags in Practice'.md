### Highlights

> What is needed for tags is some kind of taxonomy: a set of rules to follow for when to apply tags, when to create a new tag, and how tags relate to the information they are organizing. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-jamierubin-net-2022-03-08-practically-paperless-with-obsid-18e85a49939#e87a553f-9434-4578-b9c5-e330df6257c8)

Consider adding a 'Tags' page or section in the #MMW-Policy documents that gives guidelines how to use tags.

> A clearly defined taxonomy provides a scope for tagging, and more importantly, removes any abiguity from the tagging process. In other words, there is no confusion between two tags, no flitting about wondering, should I tag this note using _tag A_ or _tag B_. It is always clear from the taxonomy how best to tag a note.
