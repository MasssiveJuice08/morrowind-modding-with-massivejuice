## How To Use CSS Hex Code Colors with Alpha Values | DigitalOcean

### Highlights

> ## [Adding an Alpha Value to CSS Hex Codes](#adding-an-alpha-value-to-css-hex-codes)
> 
> Using an alpha value to update a color’s transparency will change the hex code format from `#RRGGBB` to `#RRGGBBAA` (where alpha is `A`). The first six values (the red, green, and blue ones) remain the same.
> 
> The `AA` value in `#RRGGBBAA` can range from the lowest value possible (`00`) to the highest value possible (`FF`). Lowering the value will cause the visibility to become fainter and fainter until it becomes transparent. Raising the value will cause the visibility to become more and more opaque.

All default callouts in Quartz use `10` for `--bg` (background) colour alpha, making it nearly completely transparent.
