## Publish limitations - Obsidian Help
#Omnivore

[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/https-help-obsidian-md-obsidian-publish-publish-limitations-18e85d9963d)
[Read Original](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Publish+limitations)

### Highlights

> Plugins which output in raw markdown, such as the Waypoint plugin, are compatible with Publish because they do not require the application to render their data. 
> 
> Whereas a plugin that requires a plugin codeblock to render, such as Dataview or Fantasy Statblocks, will not work by default in Publish. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-help-obsidian-md-obsidian-publish-publish-limitations-18e85d9963d#03ef8fc5-df1d-4fce-a885-b7bb5f07fde0)

The [Waypoint](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint) Obsidian plugin is compatible with Obsidian Publish; perhaps it will be compatible with Quartz?
