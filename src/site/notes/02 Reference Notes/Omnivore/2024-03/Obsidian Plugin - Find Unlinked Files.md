> ### Find orphaned files
> 
> [](#find-orphaned-files)
> 
> This plugin goes through your whole vault and searches for files, which are linked nowhere. In other words: Files with no backlinks.
> 
> In the end, it will create a file with a list of links to these orphaned files. Now you can either delete these unused files or link them somewhere in your vault.
> 
> ### Find broken links
> 
> [](#find-broken-links)
> 
> Creates a file with a list of links, which linked file has not been created yet.
> 
> In addition, there is a command to create those linked files.
> 
> ### Find empty files
> 
> [](#find-empty-files)
> 
> Creates a file with a list of empty files. Files with just frontmatter are considered empty as well. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-github-com-vinzent-03-find-unlinked-files-blob-main-readme-18e6efeba91#44f4caf3-a077-4deb-a547-56ddb2201b8d)
