You can build tables to organize information in comments, issues, pull requests, and wikis.

_This page is powered by [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app) ‐ you can read more about how I use Omnivore here: [[02 Reference Notes/Omnivore/Omnivore - Saving Articles for Citations in Obsidian\|Omnivore - Saving Articles for Citations in Obsidian]]._

### Highlights

> You can align text to the left, right, or center of a column by including colons `:` to the left, right, or on both sides of the hyphens within the header row.

Text alignment can be adjusted, but need to investigate adjusting text size with HTML tags.
