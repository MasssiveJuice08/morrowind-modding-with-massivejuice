### Dialogue

#### Questgiver -Skink-in-Tree's-Shade dialogue:
> [!question] Questgiver -Skink-in-Tree's-Shade dialogue:
> 
> Could you write quest dialogue for Skink-in-Tree's-Shade, following the structure of Morrowind's topic-based dialogue system, directing the player to search for their missing Argonian mage colleague?

> [!recite|color-orange] CGPT Response 1
> 
> Certainly! Below is an example of a quest dialogue for Skink-in-Tree's-Shade in the topic-based dialogue system of _Morrowind_, focused on the task of finding a missing Argonian mage.
> 
> This dialogue structure offers multiple paths for the player to explore based on their choices, reflecting the flexible and immersive nature of Morrowind's dialogue system. Each option leads to more information or progresses the quest in a meaningful way:

> [!example] **Upon selecting "Missing Mage"**
> 
> **Skink-in-Tree's-Shade:** "Ah, \%PCName, a matter of some urgency has arisen, and your aid would be most valuable. A colleague of ours, an Argonian mage, has not been seen for several days. Last they were known to research the patterns of Mysticism in a remote area. We fear for their safety."
>
> **Options to respond**
>
> 1. "Tell me more about this mage."
> 2. "Where were they last seen?"
> 3. "I will find them, where should I start?"
 
> [!example] **Upon selecting "Tell me more about this mage"**
> 
> **Skink-in-Tree's-Shade:** "This mage, named %ArgonianName, is a scholar of Mysticism, often venturing into dangerous territories to follow their research. Their understanding of magical patterns is unmatched, yet they have a tendency to forget the world around them. We are concerned they may have stumbled into peril."
> 
> **Options to respond**
> 
> 1. "Where were they last seen?"
> 2. "I will look for them."

> [!example] **Upon selecting "Where were they last seen?"**
>
> **Skink-in-Tree's-Shade:** "Their last known location was a cave grotto in the Sheogorad region, far to the west of Dagon Fel. It is a place steeped in magical energies and not without dangers. Few travel there, and fewer still return."
>
> **Options to respond**
> 
> 1. "I will find them, where should I start?"
> 2. "That sounds too dangerous for me."

> [!example] **Upon selecting "I will find them, where should I start?"**
>
> **Skink-in-Tree's-Shade:** "Take this scroll; it contains a spell that may help detect traces of their magical activities. Start at the cave grotto and look for any signs of their presence. Be wary, the cave is known to attract unsavory creatures."
> 
> **Options to respond**
> 1. "I will return with news, whatever it may be."
> 2. "Can you offer any advice on dealing with the dangers there?"

> [!example] **Upon selecting "Can you offer any advice on dealing with the dangers there?"**
>
> **Skink-in-Tree's-Shade:** "Stay alert, %PCName. The creatures in that region are drawn to magic. Use stealth where possible, and avoid confrontation unless necessary. Remember, the goal is to find our friend, not to clear out the cave."
>
> **Options to respond**
> 1. "I understand. I'll proceed with caution."
> 2. "I need to prepare better before I go."

> [!example] **Upon selecting "I understand. I'll proceed with caution."**
>
> **Skink-in-Tree's-Shade:** "Good luck, %PCName. We await your safe return with news of our missing colleague. May the winds be at your back."


> [!question]- Drastic changes to dialogue and give more background to Jeelish-Tar
> 
> I have an issue with the style of the dialogue. The prompts I have given such as the theory that "Mysticism's penultimate energy source was the Aetherius Itself, or else Daedric Beings of unimaginable power" are being interpreted too literally. This is useful information for we as the writers to know, but it seems heavy-handed for characters to reference this information overtly. Bear in mind, the source of mysticism's power is inconclusive and a topic of debate amongst scholars in the Elder Scrolls universe. Take, for example, these last two passages of the aforementioned book: 
> 
> 	"Discussion within the Order of Psijics after Artaeum's reappearance has led some scholars to postulate that Mysticism is less spiritual in nature as was originally supposed, and that either the intellect or the emotional state of the believer is sufficient to influence its energy configuration and flow." 
> 	
> 	"None of these explanations is truly satisfactory taken by itself. For the beginning student of Mysticism, it is best simply to learn the patterns distinguishable in the maelstrom of centuries past. The more patterns are discovered, the clearer the remaining ones become. Until, of course, they change. For inevitably they have to. And then the journey begins anew." 
>

> I also take issue with the supposition that Sheogorad is a mystical land "known for its mystical energies." More correctly, it is a barren, rugged, rocky and inhospitable land. The UESP article https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sheogorad explains it well: 
> 
> 	"The Sheogorad region is a wild maritime province consisting of about 28 islands extending into the Sea of Ghosts off the northern coast of Vvardenfell, Morrowind.[1] The high pillar-like menhirs characteristic of the area also result in hundreds of rocks, either just exposed, or lying just below the surface, which makes marine navigation almost impossible.[2] The only accessible port, Dagon Fel, is on the main island of the archipelago, reached by skirting the region and coming in from the north. The region is largely hostile and uninhabited,[1] and has a more northern climate compared to the rest of the island.[3]" 
> 	
> 	"...However, the wilds were home to plenty of smugglers,[5] bandits,[6][7] vampires,[8] and necromancers.[9] There are many ancient Velothi buildings, Dwemer ruins, and Daedric shrines throughout the region that provide ideal lairs for those who seek to skirt the eyes of the law,[2] and the perilous nature of the uninhabited islands[1] serves as a buffer against those who would seek to drive them out."

> Let's also add some more specificity to the character of Jeelish-Tar. They hold the rank of 'Wizard' in the Mages Guild. They are an accomplished mage, albeit reclusive. They lived in the Wolverine Hall Mages Guild in Sadrith Mora for some time, but found the prejudice of the local Telvanni to be a nuisance - which is no wonder, considering their propensity for keeping and trading in slaves (mostly Argonians and Khajiits, whom most Dunmer consider to be savage beastfolk and lesser beings). Being a native of Black Marsh, they had little patience for such prejudice. They stayed in Wolverine Hall for a time, made bearable by the stewardship of the local guild master Skink-in-Tree's-Shade (also an Argonian), whom they greatly respected as a colleague and friend. 
> 
> (aside: Skink-in-Tree's-Shade may have been born outside of Black Marsh, the homeland of the Argonians. This is not stated in game or referenced in any lore, but we can infer this due to the following: They have adopted a Tamrielic/Imperial name which is a translation of their Argonian name; in their written dialogue they do not speak with the typical Argonian speech patterns we established earlier; according to UESP "he also seems the most concerned about Vvardenfell's contemporary events", indicating he may have been born there instead of Black Marsh, and furthermore "This humble Argonian holds his difficult Mages Guild branch with grace and diplomacy", and "Despite being a Mages Guild member, he is somewhat respected by House Telvanni, having been noted by them as being "almost as sage and learned as Telvanni aspirants five times his age"", though "He is also rumored to carry his anti-slavery politics a little too far, much farther than Imperial law would normally allow". All of this indicates in my opinion that he was born in Vvardenfell and has adapted to its culture, albeit remaining a quietly staunch defender of Argonian freedom. Let us assume this going forward.) Jeelish-Tar eventually left Wolverine Hall to pursue their studies of Mysticism in peace, away from the slavers and common scorn of the House Dunmer and their ilk. With Skink-in-Tree's-Shade's sanction they travelled to Sheogorad to further their study of Mysticism, seeking solace in its wilds. They wrote to Skink infrequently; Sheogorad is isolated and they roamed far from any settlements. Their studies on Mysticism consisted of meditation, the nature of divinity, the Hist, Artaeum and The Psijic Order, the Dwemer and their meddling with the profane and the divine, and even Reachmen magic and the Sermons of Vivec. Fate, prophecy, divinity, magicka, mysticism, dreams and the nature of time. Their studies verged on ascertaining the nature of CHIM in the patterns of magicka (though this was not fully understood to them, and no-one involved in this story should know of or reference CHIM), but they were incapable of grappling with this concept and I believe this is what ultimately led to their fate. This background for Jeelish-Tar should not be fully-known to Skink-in-Tree's-Shade. They have only fragments of knowledge from what Jeelish shared in their writing. This biography as told by Skink should be significantly condensed and not referenced verbatim. Perhaps Skink may provide the player with correspondence they received from Skink, which goes into further details on their travels and the nature of their studied. When discussing the "patterns of mysticism" as explained and explored by Jeelish-Tar, consider using synonyms and metaphors; consider comparing the search for patterns as discerning a faint melody in an orchestra; the roots of the Hist tree or an Emperor Parasol; ripples of water. In general, avoid quoting my creative prompts verbatim unless strictly requested.
