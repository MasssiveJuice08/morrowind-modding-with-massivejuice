### Description:

A Mages Guild member studying hidden patterns of Mysticism and prophecy has gone missing. Explore their cave retreat in Sheogorad for clues about their ultimate fate. A quest outline and initial dialogue has been written, but not yet implemented; this will be added in a future update. In the meantime, you can expect a pretty cave with the mage's journal and some environmental story-telling.   
  
You can find ther cave west of Dagon Fel. Follow the road west and then north to a river crossing – the cave entrance is on the left.

### Creative Process - Quest Writing:

I experimented with using ChatGPT to develop the questline for this mod. In my personal life I have worked a lot on [Devised Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devised_theatre) and it's the type of creative process I am most familiar with, as opposed to scriptwriting. I have found ChatGPT to be a surprisingly capable tool for simulating the devising process: I fill the role of director and [dramaturg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturge), while ChatGPT is the devisor. I offer creative prompts and direction, and undertake research on lore and Morrowind's writing style. Once all the initial writing has been completed by ChatGPT, my intention is to then act as the story editor, tweaking and refining the material. 

I found this process to be a useful way of distilling my thoughts. I have ADHD, so I tend to jump from one idea/topic to another very quickly where my interests lead me (hence why I have started four separate modding projects over the course of a year and have technically finished... none?). If I'm taking decent notes along the way, I end up with a vast pile of resources and creative ideas to draw from - the difficulty then lies in tying all those together, which can feel like a monumental task (especially when just starting out). It's quite easy to be endlessly stuck in the research phase of a project and never venture into the next step of actually creating content. With ChatGPT, I have been able to feed it all my scattered, dense notes, and it immediately provides me with clear, instantaneous output.

Working with ChatGPT as a creative 'partner' makes for a very frictionless creative relationship: 
- no waiting impatiently for a response 
- immediate output 
- (humbly) responsive to creative feedback

Friction is not always a bad thing in creative processes though; conflict and restrictions can be great stimuli for creativity. With that in mind, what ChatGPT lacks as a creative tool that a human does not is:
- It can take creative feedback, but it won't give it back (unprompted, that is) - if you give it a creative prompt for a terrible script idea, _it'll do it anyway_, for better or worse.
- It won't fight for _'its'_[^1] own ideas and argue that theirs should be used over your own ideas 

### Brainstorming the Concept

"Mysticism seems to derive power from its conundrums and paradoxes"; perhaps they elucidated a paradox from the patterns of mysticism that removed them from existence. 
> 
> Please summarize your ideas in bullet-points.


> [!recite|color-purple]- ChatGPT Response 1 - Plot Outline Draft:
> - The protagonist, an adventurer, is drawn to the abandoned abode of a mage who specialized in Mysticism magic, located in the mystical land of Vvardenfell.
> - The mage's disappearance is shrouded in mystery, with rumors circulating among locals about their experiments gone awry.
> - Upon entering the mage's abode, the adventurer discovers scattered notes and journal entries detailing the mage's research into Mysticism magic.
> - The notes reveal that the mage was obsessed with uncovering a specific pattern within the chaotic currents of Mysticism, believing it to hold prophetic significance.
> - As the adventurer explores deeper into the abode, they encounter magical anomalies and manifestations of the mage's experiments, indicating the dangerous nature of their pursuits.
> - Through the notes, the adventurer learns that the mage may have inadvertently stumbled upon a paradox within the patterns of Mysticism, leading to their disappearance.
> - The climax of the story occurs when the adventurer confronts the manifestation of the paradox, a powerful entity born from the mage's experiments, which threatens to unravel reality itself.
> - Using their wits and knowledge gained from the mage's notes, the adventurer must find a way to resolve the paradox and restore balance to the mystical energies before it's too late.
> - The resolution of the story leaves the fate of the mage ambiguous, with hints suggesting they may have transcended existence or become one with the Mysticism they sought to understand.

### Expand on the central conflct:

> [!question]+ Elaborate on what the "paradox" is:
> 
> Given the themes of "mysticism and prophecy", and drawing on the lore of the Elder Scrolls Universe (excluding games released after 'TES3: Morrowind', such as Skyrim and ESO), what do you think the paradox the mage stumbled upon might be?

> [!recite|color-blue]- ChatGPT Response 4 - Plot Outline Draft:
> 
> Drawing on the themes of mysticism and prophecy within the Elder Scrolls universe, the paradox the mage stumbled upon could involve the manipulation of time and destiny. Here's a concept for the paradox:
>
> - The mage, driven by their obsession with uncovering prophetic patterns within Mysticism, delves deep into the nature of time and fate.
> - Through their research, they discover a paradoxical pattern that suggests the manipulation of one's own destiny.
> - This paradox challenges the fundamental laws governing fate and free will, suggesting that individuals can alter their destinies by foreseeing and actively changing the future.
> - As the mage delves deeper into this paradox, they inadvertently disrupt the fabric of time itself, creating ripples and anomalies that threaten the stability of reality.
> - The climax of the story occurs when the adventurer confronts the manifestation of this paradox, a twisted distortion of time and fate seeking to impose its will upon the world.
> - To resolve the paradox, the adventurer must navigate through temporal distortions and make choices that reconcile the conflicting visions of fate, ultimately restoring balance to the mystical energies.
> - The resolution leaves the fate of the mage uncertain, as they may have transcended mortal existence or become a part of the ever-shifting tapestry of prophecy and mysticism.

### Reduce scope of the quest and scale of the central conflict

> [!question]+ Change tone from apocalyptic conflict to curiosity and intrigue:
> 
> I only have a week to create this quest. Can we reduce the scope of the quest? The idea of the manifestation of the paradox is intriguing, but I don't think the player should fight it and I am opposed to the idea of it being malicious and wanting to impose its will upon the world. 
> 
> I would rather treat the story as an intriguing, curious accident with a peculiar end, rather than treat the story as something apocalyptic and world-ending. The 'protagonist' (the player character) is not so much a hero protagonist as they are an observer.

> [!recite|color-green]- ChatGPT Response 3 - Plot Outline Draft:
> 
> Of course, let's refine the scope of the quest to fit within a week's timeframe and adjust the tone to focus more on intrigue and curiosity rather than apocalyptic conflict. Here's a revised concept:
> - The adventurer, drawn to the abandoned abode of the mage, discovers scattered notes and journal entries detailing the mage's research into Mysticism magic.
> - The notes reveal the mage's obsession with uncovering a specific pattern within the chaotic currents of Mysticism, believed to hold prophetic significance.
> - As the adventurer explores deeper into the abode, they encounter magical anomalies and manifestations of the mage's experiments, indicating the mysterious nature of their pursuits.
> - Through the notes, the adventurer learns that the mage may have stumbled upon a paradox within the patterns of Mysticism, leading to their disappearance.
> - Rather than confronting a malicious manifestation of the paradox, the adventurer instead encounters subtle manifestations of its influence, such as distortions in perception and reality.
> - The climax of the story occurs when the adventurer reaches the heart of the abode, where they witness the culmination of the mage's experiments and the manifestation of the paradox itself.
> - Rather than engaging in combat, the adventurer acts as an observer, witnessing the effects of the paradox and gaining insight into its nature.
> - The resolution of the story leaves the fate of the mage uncertain, with hints suggesting they may have transcended mortal existence or become one with the Mysticism they sought to understand.
> - The quest concludes with the adventurer departing the abode, pondering the mysteries they have witnessed and the implications of the paradox they have encountered.

### Add specificity to the plot setting and characters:

> [!infobox] 
> 
> # Prompt 1:
>
> - Region: Sheogorad
> 	- Closest Settlement: Dagon Fel
> - Abode Type: Cave
> 	- Tileset: Mudcave
> - Mage Details:
> 	- Race: Khajiit
> 	- Gender: Male

> - Quest-giver: [Skink-in-Tree's Shade](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Skink-in-Tree%27s-Shade), Wolverine Hall Mage's Guild, Sadrith Mora

> [!Question]+ ChagtGPT prompt with specificity added
> 
> Let's add some specificity to the setting and characters. 
> 
> The missing mage is a khajiit male, middle-aged. He is a member of the 'Mages Guild', but perhaps is more of a hermit whose ties to the guild have waned as the years have passed and they have become lost in their studies – they have not paid their 'guild dues' (membership payment) for some time, which could be the reason you are sent to find them. 
> 
> The quest-giver could be 'Skink-in-Tree's-Shade', the guildmaster of the Wolverine Hall Mages Guild in Sadrith Mora. They themselves are proficient in Mysticism magic, so our missing khajiit mage could be a colleague of theirs.

> [!recite|color-red]- ChatGPT Response 4 - Plot Outline Draft:
> 
> Certainly, let's incorporate these specific details into the quest:
> - The missing mage is a middle-aged Khajiit, known for his reclusive nature and obsession with Mysticism magic. Despite being a member of the Mages Guild, his ties to the organization have waned over the years as he delved deeper into his studies, failing to pay his guild dues.
> - The quest-giver is Skink-in-Tree's-Shade, the guildmaster of the Wolverine Hall Mages Guild in Sadrith Mora. Skink is proficient in Mysticism magic and considers the missing Khajiit mage a colleague.
> - Skink tasks the adventurer with locating the missing mage, expressing concern for his well-being and the potential ramifications of his disappearance.
> - Upon entering the mage's abandoned abode, the adventurer discovers scattered notes and journal entries detailing the Khajiit mage's research into Mysticism magic.
> - The notes reveal the mage's fixation on uncovering a specific pattern within Mysticism, which he believes holds prophetic significance.
> - As the adventurer explores the abode, they encounter magical anomalies and manifestations of the mage's experiments, indicating the depth of his mystical pursuits.
> - The climax of the quest occurs when the adventurer reaches the heart of the abode, where they witness the culmination of the mage's experiments and the manifestation of the paradox itself.
> - Instead of engaging in combat, the adventurer observes the effects of the paradox, gaining insight into its nature and the fate of the missing mage.
> - The quest concludes with the adventurer reporting back to Skink, sharing their findings and leaving the mysteries of the Khajiit mage's disappearance open to interpretation.

<br>

> [!infobox]

> # Prompt 2:
> - Region: Sheogorad
> 	- Closest Settlement: Dagon Fel
> - Abode Type: Cave
> 	- Tileset: Mudcave-Grotto
> - Mage Details:
> 	- Race: Argonian
> 	- Gender: Male

### Change mage to be an Argonian:

> [!question] Change mage to Argonian, whose abode is a grotto:
> 
> Let's change the missing mage to an Argonian instead of a Khajiit. Their abode is a cave grotto in the region of Sheogorad. The closest settlement to them would be Dagon Fel, but this is far on the eastern side of Sheogorad, and their dwelling is to the west in the wilderness.

<br>
<br>


> [!recite|color-pink]- ChatGPT Response 5 - Plot Outline Draft:
> 
> Absolutely, let's adjust the details accordingly:
>
> - The missing mage is now an Argonian residing in a secluded cave grotto in the Sheogorad region of Vvardenfell. His reclusive nature and dedication to the study of Mysticism magic have led him to establish his abode far from civilization.
> - The closest settlement to his dwelling is Dagon Fel, located on the eastern side of Sheogorad, while his cave grotto lies to the west in the wilderness, surrounded by rugged terrain and mystical landscapes.
> - Skink-in-Tree's-Shade, the guildmaster of the Wolverine Hall Mages Guild in Sadrith Mora, remains the quest-giver, expressing concern for the missing Argonian mage and his enigmatic disappearance.
>
> **With these adjustments, the quest gains a more remote and mysterious atmosphere, fitting for the theme of mysticism and prophecy.**

<br>

### Elaborate further on the mystical paradox:

> [!question]+ Incorporate ideas of CHIM and disappearance of the Dwemer:
> 
> Let's delve deeper into what this paradox is. I like your idea in an earlier response:
"This paradox challenges the fundamental laws governing fate and free will, suggesting that individuals can alter their destinies by foreseeing and actively changing the future.
As the mage delves deeper into this paradox, they inadvertently disrupt the fabric of time itself, creating ripples and anomalies that threaten the stability of reality."
>
> Can we re-incorporate this? I want the tone to still remain one of curiosity and intrigue, rather than apocalyptic - the fate of the world does not hang in the balance due to the events that unfolded.
>
> This idea is reminiscent of [the idea of 'CHIM' in the Elder Scrolls lore](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:CHIM), which "is the process of reaching some sort of epiphany about the nature of the universe and one's place in it, leading to a simultaneous comprehension of the full scope of existence as well as one's own individuality."
>
> It is also reminiscent of [the disappearance of the Dwemer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dwemer#Disappearance_of_the_Dwemer).
>
> Ultimately the story I want to tell is a footnote in history; a curious incident without wider-reaching ramifications upon the world. The consequence or 'reward' of completing the quest would be a small insight, albeit incomplete and contradictory, into the fabric of reality of the Elder Scrolls universe. It should leave more questions than answers.

> [!recite|color-orange]+ ChatGPT Response 6 - Plot Outline Success:
> 
> Certainly, let's further develop the concept of the paradox within the context of the Elder Scrolls universe and incorporate elements reminiscent of CHIM and the disappearance of the Dwemer:
>
> - The missing Argonian mage, driven by his obsession with uncovering prophetic patterns within Mysticism, delves deep into the nature of fate, free will, and the fabric of reality.
> - Through his research, he becomes fixated on the idea that individuals can alter their destinies by foreseeing and actively changing the future, challenging the fundamental laws governing reality.
> - As he delves deeper into this paradox, he inadvertently disrupts the fabric of time itself, creating subtle ripples and anomalies that threaten the stability of reality in his immediate vicinity.
> - The manifestations of the paradox within his cave grotto are subtle and mysterious, hinting at the profound insights he has gleaned and the consequences of his meddling with the fabric of reality.
> - The climax of the quest occurs when the adventurer reaches the heart of the grotto, where they witness the culmination of the mage's experiments and the manifestation of the paradox itself.
> - Instead of engaging in combat, the adventurer experiences a moment of epiphany, gaining a fleeting understanding of the nature of reality and their place within it.
> - The resolution of the quest leaves the fate of the missing mage ambiguous, with hints suggesting that he may have achieved a state akin to CHIM or disappeared into the depths of the void.
> - The consequence or "reward" of completing the quest is a small insight into the enigmatic nature of the Elder Scrolls universe, leaving the adventurer with more questions than answers.
>
> This approach maintains the tone of curiosity and intrigue while exploring the profound mysteries of the Elder Scrolls lore. The quest serves as a footnote in history, offering players a glimpse into the deeper mysteries of the universe.

## Drafting the Mage's Journal Entries:

### First Prompt

> [!question]+ Journal Entries - First Prompt:
> 
> I'd like to move onto what the contents of their scattered notes are. Let's draft what these notes contain. Please write a series of dated journal entries, written from the perspective of our Argonian mage, that outline their research and experiments, and ultimately hint at their mysterious demise.
>
> Argonians speak with a particular cadence, somewhat poetic. You can refer to [examples of their dialogue here](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Generic_Dialogue_Voiced#Argonian_Male). 
> 
> Some examples I like are:
> - "Summoned by another, questions again."
> - "Ours is to ask, what does this visitor want?"
> - "Your turn to talk, ours to listen."
> - "Master was right to discipline us. We are foolish." ("We" is the Argonian referring to themselves as an individual, rather than a group)
> - "So strange this place. Far from the marsh."
> - "It looks unwell, unhealthy..." ("it" being the person they are speaking to)
>
> Note how when referring to another person, they often refer to them as "this" or "it", and refer to themselves as "We" or "Our".
>
> The dating convention used for the journal entries should follow the calendar of the Elder Scrolls universe (e.g., the month 'Morning Star' is the equivalent to the real-world 'January'). The events of the game 'Morrowind' begin on the 16th of Last Seed, which is the date that the legendary Nerevarine arrives in Vvardenfell by order of the Emperor. The journal entries should take place in the months leading up to this date.

> [!recite|color-yellow]- ChatGPT Response 7 - Journal Draft 1:

[This appears to be the journal of the Argonian mage, Jeelish-Tar, documenting their research into hidden patterns of Mysticism magic.]<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
2nd of Sun's Dawn, 3E 427  
<br>
New year, new paths. Mystical currents call us; this place whispers its secrets, far from the marsh.
<br>
<br>
<br>
15th of Sun's Dawn, 3E 427  
<br>
Deeper into fate’s fabric today. We see patterns, pieces of a larger puzzle. Does destiny strain, or do our eyes fail us?
<br>
<br>
<br>
23rd of Sun's Dawn, 3E 427  
<br>
Guild speaks of dues, of forgotten obligations. Coins matter little when the mysteries call so loudly. We promise to mend, yet our focus remains tethered to the unseen.
<br>
<br>
<br>
3rd of First Seed, 3E 427  
<br>
Fate can be reshaped, we discovered. To observe is one, to change is another. We tread with care, drawn by the thrill of knowledge.
<br>
<br>
<br>
12th of First Seed, 3E 427  
<br>
Our records grow. Each note a step deeper into understanding, or further from our own essence. The line blurs.
<br>
<br>
<br>
25th of First Seed, 3E 427  
<br>
Today’s experiments stir reality. Time bends, consequences shift. Are we weavers of this tapestry, or merely threads?
<br>
<br>
<br>
7th of Rain's Hand, 3E 427  
<br>
Anomalies clearer now. Our cave, once mere stone, now a nexus of possibilities. It frightens, excites us.
<br>
<br>
<br>
18th of Rain's Hand, 3E 427  
<br>
Guild words reach us again. Their understanding short of our reach. Skink-in-Tree's-Shade worries, urges return to the mundane. But we are close to something greater.
<br>
<br>
<br>
27th of Rain's Hand, 3E 427
<br>
This morning, a vision? Reality blurred. If we vanish, let these writings light the path for those who dare follow.
<br>
<br>
<br>
12th of Second Seed, 3E 427  
<br>
At the threshold now. The paradox opens before us. A door? Or are we the door ourselves? It beckons.
<br>
<br>
<br>
15th of Second Seed, 3E 427  
<br>
If this is our last, know this: we sought understanding, not power. The paradox wraps around us. We step into it, to learn, or to be unmade. Fate is not ours to command, but to meet.

### Jeelish's letter to Skink:
> [!recite]+
> 
> "Honored marshbrother, 
> This land is cold to us, but we find solace here. Sheogorad is a harsh place. It has taught us much. We trace paths whispered by wise ones. This next day, I delve into currents as deep as Hist roots. If swept away, know I walked where our swamps touch the sky. Guard our marsh-kin, as the Hist watches over us.
> Walk well, wet and dry.

### To-Do
- [ ] Jeelish-Tar's journal starts at Sun's Dawn month but talks of New Year; change month to Morning Star.

[^1]: I say 'its' ideas because authorship and plagiarism with AI language models is a contentious subject. Despite how thorough my creative prompts and feedback are, what ChatGPT outputs might still be a facsimile of someone else's work. Therefore, the final stage of heavily editing ChatGPT's work _without_ its input is a vital step to ensure that the final product is not unwitting plagiarism
