> My older sister and I discovered Morrowind back in 2005 when my friend bought me a copy for my tenth birthday (one of the Big Bytes collections games). I was a bit too young and lacked the patience and skill to understand the game's mechanics, so I mostly ran around as a level one khajiit, getting shanked by shady mudcrabs.

> My sister is a few years older though, and to me it seemed like she mastered the game. Most of my memories of Morrowind's quests and story were experienced vicariously, watching her play as a Telvanni Mage – always playing as a Breton because their magicka resistance meant they could wear the [Boots of Blinding Speed](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Boots_of_Blinding_Speed) without being blinded. I loved hearing her tell me about the Thieves Guild storyline and their clandestine conflict with the Fighters Guild. I watched her be named 'Hortator' and defeat Dagoth Ur beneath Red Mountain.

## My First Diorama

This was my first diorama. Previously I had only worked with scale miniatures, painting my [Warhammer 40,000 'Word Bearers'](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTbKT9UhZJY/?igsh=MTRqcjZ6OHRrMWE0bw==) I'd found the works of [Deloto](https://www.instagram.com/deloto51?igsh=OHJiZTF1aWRpdm5t) online and had the idea of making a diorama for my sister's birthday. As well as selling me a [Redoran Hut](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVocdiBcFd/?igsh=MXA3cnZxYnUzOG5zbg==) and some Ashlands flora sculptures, they were kind enough to throw in a few spares as well when I reached out to them.

I wanted to paint the sculptures myself so I'd asked Deloto for just the plain sculptures. Using a large round Games Workshop base, I started by sculpting the landscape using Milliput and gluing the hut, urns, scathecraw and trama root down. I applied some fine gravel and sand with PVA, then primed it all with Citadel 'Wraithbone' spray.

To get the colours right, I used Remiros' [Intelligent Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47469) as the basis and assembled the texture images into a gallery to act as my [[01 Fleeting Notes/Ald-Ruhn Colour-Palette\|Ald-Ruhn Colour-Palette]].

I really love [Citadel 'Constrast Paints'](https://citadelcolour.com/videos/contrast-paints/) (though I've yet to try their derivatives, such as [Army Painter's 'Speed Paints'](https://thearmypainter.com/collections/speedpaint)) as a way for quickly building up shadows and highlights. They are incredibly versatile Paints – when thinned down extensively with medium, they act as fantastic glazes and filters, making for smooth colour transitions. I applied multiple glazes of thinned down 'Skeleton Horde' Contrast Paint to add depth and smooth colour transition to the hut. To get the textured, worn, carapace-like appearance of the hut I stippled highlights on, and added darker shadows using 'Cygor Brown' to create pock-marked recesses in the stone.
