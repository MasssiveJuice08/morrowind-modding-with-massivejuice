> _North of Nivalis lies the island of Vilmuhn. Once home to the Dwemer complex of Bnuiolzchft and an ancient Nordic dragon cult, its rugged and cold exterior bears the scars of its former inhabitants. Embark on an expedition with the Imperial Archaeological Society to Vilmuhn and uncover what dark forces are at play to stop them before things go too far._

### Description

Originally released during the 2023 May Modathon, the mod has undergone continuous development since then without being released to the public. It is not complete by any means, with the exterior being 90% complete and work on interiors having only recently begun. However, if you're up for some sightseeing and want to offer any feedback you can download the mod files.

You can follow the mod's ongoing development and download the latest work-in-progress files on **Github** at [**Secret-of-Vilmuhn**](https://github.com/MasssiveJuice08/Secret-of-Vilmuhn), or discuss the mod in the [Morrowind Modding Community Discord](https://discord.com/channels/210394599246659585/1145919837290364929).
