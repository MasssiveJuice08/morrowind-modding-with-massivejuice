## About

Jacky Zhao (Github: [jackyzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0)) incorporates a neat little SVG widget in their Github readme file for [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz):

> <p align="center">
>  <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/jackyzha0">
>    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jackyzha0/jackyzha0/sponsorkit/sponsors.svg" />
>  </a>
> </p>

**Code:**

```html
<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/jackyzha0">
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jackyzha0/jackyzha0/sponsorkit/sponsors.svg" />
  </a>
</p>
```

Something like this could be incorporated into the [[00 Projects/Morrowind Modding Wiki/Morrowind Modding Wiki - Home\|Morrowind Modding Wiki]] as a way of recognizing wiki editors (as opposed to sponsors), perhaps as a call to action (CTA).
