[Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator) is a repository of free fonts to use on websites. Fonts can be uploaded there then embedded in sites – check the license for Mystic Cards for whether it can be uploaded there.

Alternatively the `@font-face` rule can be used – see [[02 Reference Notes/Omnivore/2024-04/How to use @font-face in CSS - CSS-Tricks - CSS-Tricks\|How to use @font-face in CSS - CSS-Tricks - CSS-Tricks]]
