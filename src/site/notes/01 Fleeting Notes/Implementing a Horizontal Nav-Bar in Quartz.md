## About

The Quartz site [Notkesto](https://notes.camargomau.com/) has added a horizontal navigation bar pinned to the top of the web page, with links to content categories. This structure could suit the [[00 Projects/Morrowind Modding Wiki/Morrowind Modding Wiki - Home\|Morrowind Modding Wiki]] well as a quick way to locate the top-level wiki categories (such as 'Guides', 'Modding Tools', 'Programmers Reference', 'Contributing' etc).

A mobile [[01 Fleeting Notes/Hamburger Menu for Quartz\|Hamburger Menu for Quartz]] could make this redundant, but the two could also complement each other.
