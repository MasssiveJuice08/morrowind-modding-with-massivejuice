## About

This is a minimal, vanilla-friendly modlist I came up with for my friend who wanted to get into Morrowind but was put off by some of its ancient Bethesda jank. Its aim is to provide:

- Modest graphical improvement without going overboard, and keeping performance in mind
- Quality of life improvements and bug fixes 
- Preserved vanilla gameplay and story experience
