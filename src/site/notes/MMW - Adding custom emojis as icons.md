Adding custom folders and note icons could be difficult. [Quartz supports adding emoji prefixes](https://discord.com/channels/927628110009098281/927628110009098284/1222014200445141044) to folders and notes, but I'm unsure if that equates to svg icons.

A workaround could be using [[02 Reference Notes/Omnivore/2024-04/Create and Use Font Awesome Custom Icons for Your Website\|FontAwesome]] to create custom emojis, and replace standard emojis such as 📁 or 📄 with bespoke Morrowind-styled emojis.
